# art-display

Created to display my art so I can record to OBS Studio.

Place your images (1080p) in the images directory
Place your audio files in the audio directory

Several functions built in to add some effects. Add the keyword to the image filename in order to add the effect.

Effect keywords: RAIN, SNOW, BLIZZARD, SPECIAL, FIREFLY, WAVE, FIREWORKS

Either run with 'python ss93.py' if your have python installed or by the executable file.
